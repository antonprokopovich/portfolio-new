          #### Key projects 
          
          <ins>Managed ML Inference Platform</ins>
        
            The platform provides functionality to simplify and optimize the following stages of working with Machine Learning models:
            - Preparing and allocating the resources (GPU/CPU/RAM) and infrastructure for running ML models.
            - Deploying and scaling models in distributed Kubernetes clusters.
            - Building model ensembles.
            - Running inference on deployed models.
            - Collecting and displaying metrics, logs and traces of deployed models.
          
          <ins>Managed Kubernetes Platform</ins>
          
            The Managed Kubernetes platform is used by majority of development teams at Sber - the largest bank in Russia.
            The platform consists of multitude of microservices. The majority of those microservices are various k8s-controllers, backends and componets that implement integrations with other services of the Cloud platform.
          
          <ins>Managed Namespaces</ins>
          
            A platform that allows users to manage namespaces in kubernetes clusters. The managed namespaces are also used to implement the communal (shared) kubernetes clusters which helps to better utilize clusters' compute resources. 
          
          #### Additional roles
          
            I'm leading a team of 4 software engineers. So besides the development work I'm also responsible for translating business goals and requirements into technical tasks, assigning those tasks to the team members, doing code reviews and testing, preparing releases, taking part in designing systems architecture and removing blockers for the team.
            
            I'm also responsible for interviewing Golang developers in multiple teams and departments. 
                      
            Other than that, I'm a member of the Sber Golang Experts Team (~20 people). The team is responsible for actively improving and developing Golang-related tools and processes in the company.

          #### Key projects
          
          <ins>DCA Trading Bot Backend</ins>
          
          During my time at Bitsgap I worked on a cryptocurrency trading bot that implemented DCA trading strategy.
          
          Besides implementing new features and improving performance, I also refactored the backend architecture and
          introduced the automated testing practices to the project.

          #### Key projects
          
          At Zyfra Robotics I worked on automating vehicles (trucks, drilling rigs) in the mining industry. Despite it being my first software engineering job I ended up as the main developer on the following projects because I was the only developer on a team of two â€“ just me and my team lead/architect.           
          
          <ins>Drilling Rig Robot Controll Software</ins>
          
          I was responsible for the development of the software that controlled the [drilling rig robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3JCit_YW5U&ab_channel=ZyfraCompany) and the infrastructure that supported them. The controll software development involved a lot mathematics (geometry, probability, linear argebra) and control theory (PID regulators, Path-Finding Algorithms, Kalman Filters).
        
          <ins>Planning and Observability Backend</ins>
        
          Besides the controll software I developed the backend that communicated with all robotic vehicles on the mine, gathered telemetry from them, sent them tasks. The backend also provided REST API for sending plans of tasks to robots (through a Web interface) and observing their current state.
        
          <ins>Remote Controll Station Desktop App</ins>
        
          I also developed a desktop app that allowed the drilling rigs to be controlled remotely using the remote-controll station built by our engineers.
        
          <ins>3D Simulator</ins>
        
          I worked on a 3D-simulator of the drilling rig which we later used for testing the main system.
        
          The automonous drilling rig was deployed on mines in Russia and Peru.

          I became a finalist of the [Global UGRAD](https://exchanges.state.gov/non-us/program/global-undergraduate-exchange-program-global-ugrad) scholarship program and went to study to the [Presbyterian College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_College) for a semester.
          
          I [scored 97](images/TOEFL_iBT.pdf) on my TOEFL exam which was a part of the Global UGRAD scholarship selection process.
          
          In addition to my business major curriculum at Presbyterian College, I took logic courses as electives.

      I've made a few _minor_ contributions to some projects in the open-source community:
      - Found [an issue](https://github.com/metal-stack/go-ipam/issues/112) in a Golang IP-management library and [added a unit test](https://github.com/metal-stack/go-ipam/pull/113/files) to reproduce it.
      - Found [an issue](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/issues/1470) with type casting in the Golang Postgres driver library pgx/v5 which was [reproduced and fixed](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/commit/e48e7a7189354fd7d2990b8abc2c40dfe5ee4c9f) by the library author.

      Besides software engineering and computer science some of my other interests are:
      - Machine Learning and AI.
      - Neuroscience. I enjoy learning about how human brain functions at a fundamental level.
      - Reading. In my spare time I read both technical and fiction literature. Planning to add my reading list on here.
      - Health and Fitness. I played basketball for 10 years in my youth and was a member of Russian U16 National Team. I enjoy weightlifting and learning/practicing anything related to becoming stronger and healthier.
